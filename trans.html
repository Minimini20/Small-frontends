            Content writers typically create content for the Web. This content c
            an include sales copy, e-books, podcasts, and text for graphics.
             Content writers use various Web formatting tools, such as HTML, 
             CSS, and JavaScript and content management systems to help create their work.
              Content writers produce the content for many different types of websites, including blogs, 
              social networks, e-commerce sites, news aggregators, and college websites.
            
            Aside from writing content, these writers might also be responsible for making sure the
             sites' pages and content connect. They're also responsible for setting the overall tone 
             of the site. Content writers accomplish these tasks by researching and deciding what information
              to include or exclude from the site.
            
            Required Education
            Content writers may need a bachelor's degree or higher. Many employers hire writers
             with degrees in English, journalism, communications, or creative writing. Depending on the subject matter, content writers might need a degree in a particular field. For example, a content writer creating content for an online math course might need a degree in math in addition to demonstrating solid writing skills.
            
            Content writers might enroll in electronic writing certificate programs. These programs
             are available at the undergraduate and graduate levels and offer courses in such topics as Web design, blogging, wikis, electronic rhetoric, and technical writing. In many cases, employers are more considered about writing and grammar skills than with education. Many employers require a writing test to be completed by applicants
